#Moonlight Embedded

Moonlight is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream, as used by the NVIDIA Shield,
but built for Linux/OSX/Windows.

Moonlight Embedded allows you to stream your full collection of Steam games from
your powerful Windows desktop to your embedded system, like Raspberry Pi, CuBox-i and Hummingboard.

For a demo see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRW6O0bSHNw).

##Features

* Streams Steam and all of your games from your PC to your embedded system.
* Use mDNS to scan for compatible GeForce Experience (GFE) machines on the network.
* Qwerty Keyboard, Mouse and Gamepad support
* Support Raspberry Pi and i.MX 6 devices

##Requirements

* [GFE compatible](http://shield.nvidia.com/play-pc-games/) computer with GTX 600/700/900 series GPU (for the PC you're streaming from)
* High-end wireless router (802.11n dual-band recommended) or wired network
* Geforce Experience 2.1.1 or higher

##Quick Start

* Ensure your machine and embedded system are on the same network
* Turn on Shield Streaming in the GFE settings
* Start Moonlight Embedded with pair
* Accept the pairing confirmation on your PC
* Start Moonlight Embedded with stream
* Play games!
